            "content": "Equation of a line . $$ Large y = mx + c$$ . The equation given is the equation for a straight line. m -&gt; slope, c -&gt; y-intercept, x -&gt; x-coordinate . Points to be noted . Slope is same everywhere on a line | Two parellel lines have the same slope | Intersecting lines have different slopes | General form of the equation of a straight line . $ large ax + by + c = 0 $ . Rearranging to get it into the slope - intercept form gives: . $ large y = frac{-c-ax}{b} = frac{-a}{b}x + frac{-c}{b} $ . Here, m = $ Large frac{-a}{b}$ &amp; c = $ Large frac{-c}{b}$ . If we generalize the equation to n dimensions . $ large w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + dots + w_0 = 0 $ . $ large x_1, x_2, dots large w_1, w_2, dots $ . Equation of a plane . $ large pi : ax + by + cz + d = 0 large L: ax + by + c = 0 $ . $ large pi$ is used to represent plane . We can also write it as a more general notation: . $ large pi : w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + w_3x_3 + w_0 = 0$ . Equation of a hyperplane . When the number of dimensions is greater than 2, then we call it hyper-plane It is represented by: $ large pi_d$ . It&#39;s equation is: . $ large pi_d : w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + dots + w_dx_d + w_0= 0$ . Vectors in Linear Algebra . The above picture is what a vector is. It has a magnitude and a direction. . The magnitude of the above vector is calculated by: $ large || vec u|| = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. This is a 2-d vector. . For a &#39;d&#39; dimensional vector the formula is generalized to: $ large || vec x|| = sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + dots + x_d^2}$ . The equation of a hyperplane: $ large pi_d : w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + dots + w_dx_d + w_0= 0$ . can be rewritten in a matrix form using Linear algebra: . $ large begin{bmatrix} w_1 dots w_d end{bmatrix} begin{bmatrix} x_1 vdots x_d end{bmatrix} + w_0 = 0$ . $ large W in R^d$, which means W is a d-dimensional vector and all it&#39;s values are real numbers. $ large w_0 $ is a scalar. . The Vector with all $ large w$s is a row vector &amp; the vector with all $ large x $s is a column vector In maths, when we say vector we mean a column vector by convention . We can write this in a more concise way: $ large W^Tx + w_0 = 0$ . Dataset . The above is the example of a dataset. This one is the famous Iris dataset.Iris dataset contains 4 features(SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm) and a target(3 types of flowers) Each row has 4 columns representing the features and the last column is the target(the thing we want to predict) . We can have a concise mathematical representation of a dataset as: . $ large D = {(x_i, y_i); x_i in R^d, y_i in {c_1, c_2} }$ . $ large x_i$ represents one feature vector(one row of columns except the target ones) $ large y_i$ represents one target vector . Angle between Vectors . Here we need the notion of a dot product. This is taken from Wikipedia . In mathematics, the dot product or scalar product is an algebraic operation that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers (usually coordinate vectors), and returns a single number. In Euclidean geometry, the dot product of the Cartesian coordinates of two vectors is widely used. It is often called &quot;the&quot; inner product (or rarely projection product) of Euclidean space, even though it is not the only inner product that can be defined on Euclidean space (see Inner product space for more). Algebraically, the dot product is the sum of the products of the corresponding entries of the two sequences of numbers. Geometrically, it is the product of the Euclidean magnitudes of the two vectors and the cosine of the angle between them. . From the last line of the definition, . $ large vec A cdot vec B = | vec A|| vec B| cos theta = vec A ^ T vec B$ . After rearranging, . $ Large theta = cos ^ {-1} left ( frac{ vec A cdot vec B}{| vec A|| vec B|} right )$ . If $ large theta$ is 0 then, vectors are perpendicular . Special cases of equation of a plane . One more concept we need is the concept of a unit vector. A unit vector is a vector whose magnitude is 1. Represented by $ large hat x $ called the &quot;hat&quot; symbol. . 1. Passing through origin . Equation recap: $ large pi : w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + w_3x_3 + w_0 = 0$ . for the plane to pass through origin, $ large x_1, x_2, x_3 = 0$. Plugging these values in the equation we have: $w_0 = 0$. This is the equation of plane passing through origin . 2. Not passing through origin . Equation of plane in vector form: . $ large w^Tx + w_0 = 0 $ $ large =&gt; ||w||||x|| cos theta = 0 $ $ large =&gt; ||x|| cos theta + w_0 = 0 $ (as $ large w $ is a unit vector) $ large ||x|| cos theta = a $ (from the figure) . So, finally $ large a = -w_0$ . As you can see, $ large a$ is the distance of the plane from the origin. So, what we see is the distance of a plane not passing through origin is $ large |w_0|$ provided $ large w$ is a unit vector. . if $ large w$ is not a unit vector then $ large a = frac{|w_0|}{||w||}$ . We can prove it like this: $ large w cdot x + w_0 = 0$ $ large =&gt; ||w||||x|| cos theta + w_0 = 0 $ $ large =&gt; ||w|| a + w_0 = 0 $, as $ large ||x|| cos theta = a$ (from the figure) $ large =&gt; a = frac{-w_0}{||w||} $ . but ofcourse we can do away with the -ve sign as distance can&#39;t be negative. So, $ large a = frac{|w_0|}{||w||} $ . Half Spaces .",

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
